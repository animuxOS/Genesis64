- create automatic camera movement to focused part. In example, if the
  user press "nose", the camera zoom on the nose.  Perhaps this could be  
  compined with Hotspot support in animorph

  series

- Add verts to mesh, to make clothes and extra details

- Study/apply rendering features by renderman

- Redo from scratch all target icons

- a little transparency bug in some toolbar icons

- Select the best targets, and delete retundant/nosense targets

- BUG: something is wrong with axis and grid angle
  -> grid corrected, but axis too?

- BUG: if closing MakeHuman not with <ESC>, but with window menu I get a segfault and core file on Linux. Need to investigate this!

- rewrite README.txt and explain licence

- the target buttons in face and body are mirrored. See if this is a mhgui or makehuman problem and fix it

- show splash image

- use windres in xmingw 

- replace the "cp" command in Makefile.am with "find --exec cp"

- fix the "make distcheck" problem
