- create binary format files [probably abandoned]

- muscle engine

- hair rendering

- Asymmetry system (easy) some typical asymmetrical targets [@Manuel: could you explain this?]

- Symmetry system: read the targets like l_my_target.target and check if
  r_my_target.target is applied. If not it's applied.

- Add a geometry smooth function, like Blender special transformation.
  It'a a sort of mesh relax. [@Manuel: could you explain this?]

- split animorph into several small libraries

- export vertex groups in OBJ file

- use the same convention to get data from objects. Currently sometimes 
  we access "x" direct or x() or getX().
