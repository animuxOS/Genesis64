Lights and the camera are also defined as scene objects. Render settings are defined in YourScene.setting.xml (i.e. most of the settings in this dialog). The actual meshes are stored in YourScene.objects.obj file; that means that you don't have to export the the meshes for every rendering, i.e. if you only change something in the materials or in this dialog you don't have to export the meshes again."},

    {5,"Camera lets you choose between two different type of cameras.The pinhole camera is the simplest one. Since it has infinite depth of field, objects can't be out of focus and thus never appear blurred. The thin lens camera is slightly more complex (and much more plausible) than the pinhole camera. It will produce depth of field according to the fstop, focaldistance and focallength  parameters. Out of focus objects will appear blurred.\nFstop: this is the aperture number or f-stop number.\n     Lens diameter is computed as follow: \n     lensdiameter = focallength / fstop.\n Focal length: focal length of the camera, expressed in meters.\nAdditionally, one of the two following parameters must be defined: focaldistance or autofocus. Focal distance of the camera, expressed in meters. The focal distance is the distance along the view direction at which objects will be in focus.Autofocus is a point, in the image plane, which will be in focus. Bottom left corner of the image plane is at (-0.5, -0.5), and upper right corner is at (0.5, 0.5), regardless of the image resolution. "},
