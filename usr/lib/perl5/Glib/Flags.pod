=head1 NAME

Glib::Flags -  Overloaded operators representing GLib flags

=for object Glib::Flags Overloaded operators representing GLib flags

=for position DESCRIPTION

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Glib maps flag and enum values to the nicknames strings provided by the
underlying C libraries.  Representing flags this way in Perl is an interesting
problem, which Glib solves by using some cool overloaded operators. 

The functions described here actually do the work of those overloaded
operators.  See the description of the flags operators in the "This Is
Now That" section of L<Glib> for more info.
