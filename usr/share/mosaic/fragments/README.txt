This is a library of code fragments meant to aid in rapid scene design.

They are named according to the standard area prefixes used in MOSAIC (found in the settings tab).
This library only contains standard shaders mentioned in the RenderMan(R) specification.
For this reason you will need to create your own fragments with the features specific to your
renderer or rendering techniques, however this makes a great starting place to build your own
Library!

To use just browse these files from the "Open" window in the Blender text editor, and insert
the fragments you want in your project. Refer to any comments within the fragments to understand
how to use or setup the fragments within your scene. Then link these fragments to the objects,
lights, scenes, groups, or materials that you want these shaders hooked to.
