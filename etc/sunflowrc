# Sunflow wrapper configuration file
#
# Please refer to sunflow(1) for the list of supported options.
# Uncomment and adjust the variables at your convenience.
#
# One can overwrite these settings using a ~/.sunflowrc file,
# or using environment variables.

# Do not use the default "java" binary, handled via alternatives, but
# another virtual machine:
#
# export SUNFLOW_JAVA=/path/to/some/jvm

# Automatically pass these options to the java interpreter. In this example:
#  - start the VM server
#  - use a memory upper limit of 500M
#
# Note that the use of quotation marks if more than one option is passed
# is important.
#
# export SUNFLOW_JAVA_OPTIONS="-server -Xmx500M"

# Automatically pass these options to sunflow.
#
# export SUNFLOW_OPTIONS=""
