#
#  Function:  
#    This is a list of files to exclude DURING THE UPDATECLIENT PROCESS 
#    ONLY.  If you want to exclude files or directories during a 
#    "getimage" operation, use "man getimage" or "getimage --help" 
#    to see the "-exclude PATH" and "-exclude-file FILE" options.
#
#  This file supercedes systemimager.exclude.  systemimager.exclude is now
#  depricated and is not used.
#



# Do NOT modify these exclusions or VERY STRANGE things may happen!

# are now depricated, but may still exist on older systems.

# You may modify or add to the exclusions below at your own risk...
# -- Wait a minute, this is all at your own risk! ;)
#
# You should consider modifying this file on both on the client and in
# the image stored on the image server.  If you only modify it on the 
# client, it will be replaced by the one in the image you are updating
# to.  If you only modify it in the image, you will need to run 
# updateclient twice for it to take effect.  The first run will pull 
# the new file to your client, and the second run will actually make 
# use of the new file.
